<h2>Figure 4CD</h2>
<h3>List of files</h3>
(1) run_code.py
This file runs all the code in steps 1,2 and 3, generating the data in 'Data/' and the 
figures in 'Figures/'.

(2) Step1-wake_learning/UP-state-mediated_plast_fig4CD_wake.py
Simulates a feedforward network of integrate-and-fire neurons with plastic excitatory
synapses. The synapses are updated following a standard STDP rule and some neurons receive
50% stronger currents than the others. This code uses functions and parameters in 
SimStep.py and params.py. 

(3) Step2-sleep_learning/UP-state-mediated_plast_fig4CD_sleep.py
Simulates a feedforward network of integrate-and-fire neurons with plastic excitatory
synapses. Synaptic weights are initiated as the final weights from (1). Those weights are 
updated followin the Up-state-mediated plasticity described in [1]. This code uses 
functions and parameters in SimStep.py and params.py. 

(4) Step3-figures/Make_fig4CD.py
Plots and save the figure generated with the data produced from (1) and (2). Figures are 
saved in Figures/.


<h3>To simulate the network and plot the figures  </h3>

1. run (1): simulates the network, saves the results and generate figure 4CD (below);

<h2>Figure 4E</h2>
<h3>List of files</h3>
(1) run_code.py
This file runs UP-state-mediated_plast_fig4E for 200 trials, which creates all the data 
in Data/

(2) UP-state-mediated_plast_fig4E.py
Simulates the network and saves the data in Data/

(3) Make_fig4E.py
Gets the data in Data/ as input, generate the figure and save it in Figures/

(4) SimStep.py
Functions to be used in each integration time step. These fundtions are called from (2)

(5) params.py
Parameters used by (2)


<h3>To simulate the network and plot the figures  </h3>

1. run (1): simulates the network, saves the results and generate figure 4E (below);
